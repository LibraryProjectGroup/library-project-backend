### Using DevContainers

> Note: The fall 2023-team removed the devcontainers as they were not used.

> Note: These files have not been used or updated in a while so it's possible that this does not work.

The [.devcontainer](.devcontainer/) folder contains files for developing the backend in a [VS Code Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). See installation and usage instructions at [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
