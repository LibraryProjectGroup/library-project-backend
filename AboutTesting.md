  ### Run Robotframwork tests

[*Updated 6.10.2023*]
  Currently not recommended, tests will fail because tests require username and password to be hard coded into package.json to pass, robottests are currently used in workflows where test can be ran with GitHub secrets.

  Testing with robot:

 - Run following command:
  ```
npm run test
  ```
